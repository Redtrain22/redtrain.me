	I'm Redtrain22, I go by Red as a shorthand. I'm someone who likes to code and play some video games. If you want some of my projects that I did you
	can look on GitHub for what I do. Programming is a hobby I have because it constantly challenges me. Video games I generally just play what my
	friends play, usually with an emphasis on multiplayer FPS games.
